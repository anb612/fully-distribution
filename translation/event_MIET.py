import sympy as sp

# Declare symbols
r, C, A, B, F, t = sp.symbols('r C A B F t')

# Assumptions (equivalent to 'assume' in MATLAB)
assumptions = [C > 0, B > 1, A > 0]

# Define the differential equation
diff_equ = - C * (A * r**2 + r + B)

# Solve the differential equation using sympy's dsolve
solution = sp.dsolve(diff_equ, r)

# Simplify the solution
simplified_solution = sp.simplify(solution)

# Display the solution in a readable format (pretty print)
sp.pprint(simplified_solution)

# If you wanted to solve for a particular value, you would use solve, e.g.:
# S = sp.solve(simplified_solution, r)
# sp.pprint(S)
